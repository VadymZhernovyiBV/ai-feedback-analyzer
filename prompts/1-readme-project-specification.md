I have a pet project to approach with agentic coding and context engineering, help me fill the gaps in the project description and clarify all the ambiguities and details

<project_description>
Here’s a concise, technically accurate English translation:

**Pet Project:**
**Topic:** AI Feedback Analyzer

**Idea:**
A platform for analyzing customer feedback using an ML model that determines emotional tone and categorizes the feedback.

**Description:**
The user submits feedback (text), and the system:
- Analyzes it via ML (sentiment + category)
- Stores the history
- Enables filtering, sorting, and tagging

**Basic Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit (better for scaling) / Context API
- Material UI / or any other styling components (including custom ones)
- Backend – ? (at your discretion)

**Basic User Flow:**
- User enters feedback
- Clicks “Analyze”
- Receives result:
  - Sentiment: positive / neutral / negative
  - Category: support, billing, product feedback, etc.
- History is stored (localStorage – for quick storage, purely for on-page visualization)
